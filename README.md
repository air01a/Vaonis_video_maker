# Vaonis_video_maker
Make a video from jpg output files (align frames, add title, add post processed image, ...)

Vaonis produces JPEG images throughout the entire stacking process. So, we get the result of a single image, then two stacked images, then three, and so on. I find it interesting to be able to show how the quality improves as the stacking progresses, and I wanted to make a video out of it. However, the JPEG images are not aligned, which makes the result less convincing. 

I created this script to align the images and automatically produce the final video.
